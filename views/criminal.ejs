    Police brutality refers to the use of unnecessary use of force by a police
    officer. The use of such tools as pepper spray, batons, and teasers, as well
    as hitting, choking, throwing a non-combatant civilian to the ground, and
    sexual abuse are all examples of physical police brutality. It can be a
    physical as well as verbal abuse or racial profiling and false arrest. Many
    countries have their laws for police brutality. It is considered as a severe
    offence but still, there are cases where the complaints of civilians or
    victim do not even reach to the investigation stage. It is very difficult to
    prove that the police are using excessive force or not. In defense, the
    civilian has started to record the videos of their interaction with the
    police officer and the same is done by the police officer in his or her
    defense.
